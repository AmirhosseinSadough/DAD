TODO:
- Add datasets from :
	- Emmot et al.: https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/datasets/47429f155?locale=en
	- The Robust Multi-Scale Deep-SVDD Model for Anomaly
Online Detection of Rolling Bearings
	- An Ensembled Anomaly Detector for Wafer Fault Detection
	- https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench#datasets
		- backdoor: https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset
			- must cite 5 papers for dataset
			- can't use entire dataset (too large), perhaps just use training set
		- campaign:
		- fault
		- magic-gamma
		- skin
		- yeast
		- WBC/WDBC (we have the 30D one), what about the other (9D)?
	- https://github.com/GuansongPang/ADRepository-Anomaly-detection-datasets/tree/main/numerical%20data/DevNet%20datasets
	all of these are from the DevNet paper
		- donors
		- backdoor
		- bank
		- celeba
		- census
		- fraud
	- extended AE for novelty detection:
		X https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification
		X https://github.com/narayave/mh5_anomaly_detector UNUSABLE
		X https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inIT-OWL/high-storage-system-data-for-energy-optimization TWO DATASETS
		X https://www.kaggle.com/shasun/tool-wear-detection-in-cnc-mill
		

- Add additional methods:
	- Deep methods: (in PyOD)
		X AE
		X VAE
		X beta-VAE 
		X DeepSVDD #not used in favor of LukasRuff version
		- SO-GAAL
		- MO-GAAL
		- AnoGAN (too complex to get to work?)
		X LUNAR
		- ALAD
	X DeepSVDD from LukasRUFF
	- DAGMM: https://github.com/mperezcarrasco/PyTorch-DAGMM ( no easily adaptable implementations available)
	- Non deep:
		X Robust KDE #no implementations.
		X SVDD (https://github.com/iqiukp/SVDD-Python)
		X Ensemble GMM (see Emmot et al.) (likely too much work) #no implementations
		X random cut forests (https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf)
		- PyOD:
			X GMM			
			X i-nne
			X KDE
			X R-graph
			- KPCA: needs %variance interface to work
