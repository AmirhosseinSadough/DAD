# DECODE: Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection

This repository extends the benchmarking framework proposed in [Outlier Detection: Benchmarking Methods and Evaluation Criteria](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0570.html) and its corresponding GitHub repository: [outlierdetection](https://github.com/RoelBouman/outlierdetection). Our extension introduces evaluations based on a new benchmarking approach, **Hyperparameter Tuning-based (HPT-based)** benchmarking, along with default hyperparameter settings and peak performance evaluations.

Additionally, we have incorporated synthetic datasets and an IIoT dataset (DAMADICS) into the benchmark. The reference framework has been modified to accommodate these new additions.
